👋 Hi, I’m @modlinkadmitrich
👀 I’m interested in understanding the complexities of human behavior and the factors that influence our decisions.
🌱 I’m currently learning about psychology and behavioral economics to gain insights into why we think and act the way we do.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research projects or initiatives that explore the intersection of psychology and other fields such as marketing, finance, or social sciences.
📫 If you're interested in discussing psychological research or have ideas for collaboration, feel free to reach out to me via emai
